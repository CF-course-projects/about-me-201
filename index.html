    <p>My name is Shane Roach. I currently live in Seattle, Washington. I recently graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in Ecological Engineering. Since then I have been working in the climbing gym industry as a gym operator, supervisor, and route setter. Some of my big interests include drawing, painting, worldbuilding, hiking, and climbing.</p>
